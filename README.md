# Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains the projects Udacity Deep Learning Nanogree.

### Project 1: Introductory Project - Predicting Bike Sharing Data
Description: a fully connected neural network is used to predict future bike-sharing service usage based on past data.

### Project 2: Convolutional Neural Networks - Dog Breed Classifier
Description: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to determine whether an image contains a human, a dog, or neither. If a dog is detected in the image, the program attempts to guess the breed. If a human is detected, the program returns the resembling dog breed.

### Project 3: Recurrent Neural Networks - Generate TV Scripts
Description: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to generate text resembling a TV script based on past episodes of the Simpsons.

### Project 4: Generative Adversarial Networks - Generate Faces
Description: a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate images resembling human faces based on a dataset of celebrity images.

### Project 5: Deep Reinforcement Learning - Teach a Quadcopter to Fly
Description: a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method is used to train a model quadcopter to take off and reach the target altitude.
